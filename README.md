## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) is a series of small programming puzzles designed to be solved in any programming language. The puzzles are released daily throughout the month of December, each with increasing difficulty. They are suitable for a wide range of skill levels and can be solved using various programming languages.

The puzzles are not only fun to solve but also serve as excellent practice for interview preparation, company training, university coursework, or simply as a challenging way to keep your programming skills sharp.
